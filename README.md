### Design Patterns & Guidelines

- **Presentational vs. Container**  
  Keep UI logic (layout, styling) separate from data fetching/business logic.  
- **Props-Driven**  
  All dynamic data flows in via props; components remain stateless whenever possible.  
- **Atomic Design**  
  Build from ‚Äúatoms‚Äù (e.g. `Rating`, `Button`) ‚Üí ‚Äúmolecules‚Äù (e.g. `SearchBar`) ‚Üí ‚Äúorganisms‚Äù (e.g. `Navbar`) ‚Üí ‚Äútemplates‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúpages.‚Äù  
- **Styling**  
  We‚Äôll use CSS Modules (or Tailwind) for scoping; follow a mobile‚Äëfirst approach using flexbox and grid.  
- **Accessibility**  
  - All interactive elements keyboard‚Äëfocusable  
  - ARIA labels on carousels, form fields, and toggles  
  - Semantic HTML (e.g. `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`)
