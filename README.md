| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Navbar**      | Site header with logo, navigation links, user menu, and mobile toggler.                     | `links: Array<{ label: string; href: string }>`<br>`currentUser?: User`<br>State: `isMenuOpen: boolean` |
| **SearchBar**   | Input + filters for property search (location, dates, guests)                                 | `onSearch: (criteria) => void`<br>`defaultValues?`    |
| **PropertyCard**| Displays a single property in the listing: image, title, price, location, and favorite toggle | `property: Property`<br>`onToggleFavorite: () => void` |
| **ImageCarousel** | Reusable carousel for cycling through multiple images                                | `images: string[]`<br>`autoPlay?: boolean`            |
| **Rating**      | Shows star rating and number of reviews                                                      | `value: number`<br>`max?: number`                    |

### Design Patterns & Guidelines

- **Presentational vs. Container**  
  Keep UI logic (layout, styling) separate from data fetching/business logic.  
- **Props-Driven**  
  All dynamic data flows in via props; components remain stateless whenever possible.  
- **Atomic Design**  
  Build from “atoms” (e.g. `Rating`, `Button`) → “molecules” (e.g. `SearchBar`) → “organisms” (e.g. `Navbar`) → “templates” → “pages.”  
- **Styling**  
  We’ll use CSS Modules (or Tailwind) for scoping; follow a mobile‑first approach using flexbox and grid.  
- **Accessibility**  
  - All interactive elements keyboard‑focusable  
  - ARIA labels on carousels, form fields, and toggles  
  - Semantic HTML (e.g. `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`)
